We will use our control flow statements to iterate through collections and filter out or selectively operate on each element. We'll use `while` loops to perform operations until a given condition is no longer true. "

This is useful for instances where we do not have a collection or do not need a collection to solve our problem, especially when we would only like to stop the process according to a certain condition. We then practiced using control flow statements, `break` and `continue`, to selectively operate on elements, append them to new lists, or assign them to new variables."
